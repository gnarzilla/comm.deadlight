# Deadlight Comm

**Deadlight Comm** is a modular, edge-native communication framework for people who want more than just email. Itâ€™s an inbox that can receive anythingâ€”from email, RSS, contact forms, to system alertsâ€”and lets you reply in Markdown, automate flows, and own your data. Built around core values of data ownership, transparency, and user empowerment.

## âœ¨ Vision

A personal communication operating systemâ€”running at the edge, written in modular components, and designed to evolve with the user.

- Edge-native: deployable on Cloudflare, Deno, or other edge compute platforms.
- Markdown-first: every message is treated like a readable, portable blog post.
- Modular: components for parsing, fetching, storing, and rendering can be swapped or extended.
- Privacy-focused: users retain full data ownership and can export at any time.

## ðŸ§± Architecture Overview

Deadlight Comm is composed of:

- **Proxy Layer** â€“ C-based server that speaks raw IMAP/SMTP and delivers JSON.
- **Worker Layer** â€“ Cloudflare Worker handling auth, parsing, routing, and UI orchestration.
- **Parser Module** â€“ Wasm-powered message parser with support for plain text, HTML, and attachments.
- **UI Layer** â€“ Inbox-as-blog frontend for reading and replying in Markdown.
- **Storage Layer** â€“ D1 for metadata, R2 (optional) for attachments.
- **Plugin Hooks** â€“ Add new capabilities like AI summaries, spam filters, or SMS routing.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone this repo and get the basic environment up and running.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/deadlight-labs/deadlight-comm.git
cd deadlight-comm
make setup
make dev
```

Modules are contained in their own directories and initialized via Makefile targets.
## ðŸŽ¯ Philosophy

Deadlight Comm is built around:
- Modularity â€“ Each component is replaceable.
- Transparency â€“ All actions are observable, debuggable, and documented.
- Data Sovereignty â€“ The user owns their inbox and can walk away with their data at any time.
- Composability â€“ Future plugins and new protocols can be easily added.
